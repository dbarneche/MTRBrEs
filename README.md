## Instructions

All analyses were done in `R`. To compile the paper, including figures and tables we use the [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) package for R. You can install remake using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("richfitz/remake", dependencies=TRUE)
```
(run `install.packages("devtools")` to install devtools if needed.)

The `remake` package also depends on `storr`, install it like this:
```r
devtools::install_github("richfitz/storr", dependencies=TRUE)
```

You also need to install the software `JAGS`, as per these instructions [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/?source=typ_redirect).

Next you need to open an R session with working directory set to the root of the project.

We use a number of packages, missing packages can be easily installed by remake:

```r
remake::install_missing_packages()
```

And then install the package `fontcm`, via `extrafont`. This installs the font `CM Roman` we use in our figures (for more information on see [these instructions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fontcm/README.html):

```r
extrafont::font_install('fontcm')
```

Then, to generate all figures, analyses, and manuscript (.docx, using Rmarkdown), simply do:

```r
remake::make()
```

All output will be automatically placed in a directory called `output` (it is going to be automatically created for you).

Also notice that the Bayesian analysis in this paper will take 20â€“30 min to run on a regular computer.

If you find remake confusing and prefer to run plain R, you can use remake to build a script `build.R` that produces a given output, e.g.

```r
remake::make_script(filename="build.R")
```
