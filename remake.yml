## All R files that are used must be listed here:
sources:
  - paths.R
  - R/functions-analyses.R
  - R/functions-figures.R

## Most of a remakefile will be targets.  They can be listed in any
## order; whatever makes most sense.  Files can be split up and
## included into the main file if you need to impose more structure.
targets:
  ## 'all' is a special target that will be used as the default
  ## target by 'remake'.  It doesn't actually make anything but
  ## 'depends' on other targets.
  all:
    depends: outputs/RDatafiles/analyses.RData

  ## 'target_name' is a special variable here: it will pass 'data.csv'
  ## through to the function 'download_data()' so that the data are
  ## stored in the correct place.
  metRates:
    command: readAndCleanData('data/data.csv')

  ## 'processed' will be stored as an R object because it looks like
  ## an object name rather than a file name (file names have
  ## extensions or slashes in them).  It will be saved across
  ## sessions.  Because it uses 'data.csv', remake will work out that
  ## this target depends on 'data.csv'.
  output/RDatafiles/analyses.RData:
    command: produceAnalysesOutputs(metRates)
    
  ## Specifying 'plot: true' here tells remake that you are creating a
  ## plot.  It will sort out opening/closing the pdf device for you.
  ## Because 'myplot' uses 'processed', remake will work out that this
  ## target requires the processed target to be made first.
