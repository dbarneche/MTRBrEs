**Abstract**  

Organismal metabolic rate often scales allometrically with body mass.  This pattern is observed in both interspecific and ontogenetic (intraspecific) studies, but the causal basis of variation in the allometric scaling of metabolism remains unresolved.  In the present study, we use a manipulative approach to test for an association between ontogenetic metabolic scaling and the rate and form of growth in three phyla of colonial marine organisms. Based on a Dynamic Energy Budget model that predicts the scaling of metabolic rate on the basis of energy allocation to assimilation, maintenance, growth, and maturation, we hypothesise that the scaling exponent of metabolic rate for colonial organisms should be dependent on growth rate for two-dimensional (encrusting) colonies, but not for three-dimensional (arborescent) colonies.  In support of this hypothesis, we found that the scaling exponent of metabolic rate decreased with increasing growth rate for encrusting colonies, but not for arborescent ones. These findings highlight the importance of growth for metabolic scaling during ontogeny, suggest that differences in patterns of growth might explain at least some of the documented variation in the scaling exponent of metabolic rate, and lead to novel and testable predictions for associations between individual metabolism and community structure.  
  
**Introduction**  

Metabolic theories have been lauded as having the potential to unite hierarchical levels of biological organisation, from individuals to ecosystems `r myCite(c('nisbet2000janimecol', 'brown2004', 'vandermeer2006tree'))`. Although definitive tests of their underlying assumptions remain rare `r myCite(c('kearney2012amnat', 'newberry2015ploscomputbiol'))`, myriad studies examined their predictions with regards to the relationship between individual level metabolic rates, $B_i$, and individual body mass, $M_i$ `r myCite(c('kleiber1932', 'kleiber1961', 'peters1983', 'schmidtnielsen1984', 'glazier2005biolrev', 'delong2010', 'glazier2010biolrev'))`. The relationship between $B_i$ and $M_i$ is typically described by a power function of the form $B_i = B_oM_i^{\alpha}$, where $B_o$ is a normalisation constant independent of mass and $\alpha$ is a dimensionless scaling exponent. For most animals, individual metabolic rate scales sub-linearly with body mass, with $\alpha$ estimates falling between 0.5 and 1, and averaging around 0.75 `r myCite(c('kleiber1961', 'savage2004', 'glazier2005biolrev', 'delong2010'))`. Metabolic rates are also influenced by temperature. Two prevalent competing metabolic theories, the fractal geometry model `r myCite(c('west1997science', 'west1999science'))`, and  the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory for metabolic organisation `r myCite('kooijman2009book')`, provide opposing views on the role of temperature on metabolic rates and the relationship between the mass scaling of metabolic rates and temperature: the former assumes that temperature affects the metabolic normalisation only `r myCite('gillooly2001')`, i.e. mass-scaling and temperature dependence are independent; contrarily, the latter predicts changing relationships between mass scaling and temperature dependence through the effects of temperature on assimilation, maintenance, growth, and maturation `r myCite('kooijman2009book')`.  
  
Empirical studies of the intra-specific association between $B_i$ and $M_i$ have revealed that the value of $\alpha$ is associated with many biotic and abiotic variables, including pH `r myCite('vaca2010biollett')`, temperature `r myCite('killen2010ele')`, predation `r myCite('glazier2011ecolmongr')`, inbreeding `r myCite('ketola2012jlinsoc')`, and a range of others (for reviews see `r myCite(c('glazier2005biolrev', 'white2013jcompphysb'))`). Similarly, inter-specific studies have shown that the value of $\alpha$ varies among taxa and/or locations (e.g. `r myCite(c('lovegrove2000amnat', 'white2012procb', 'barneche2014ele'))`), with metabolic level (e.g. `r myCite('glazier2010biolrev')`), and sometimes with body mass (e.g. `r myCite(c('white2009evolution', 'kolokotrones2010nature'))`). While these intra- and inter-specific studies demonstrate clearly that the value of $\alpha$ is not fixed, they each share a common limitation: each study tests for an association between $\alpha$ and a biotic or abiotic variable, using a value of $\alpha$ that is estimated from the association between $B_i$ and $M_i$ for individuals or species of different size. Such correlative studies cannot address the causal association between $B_i$ and $M_i$, because $M_i$ is correlated with a range of other environmental, physiological, and life history variables (see e.g. `r myCite(c('peters1983', 'calder1984book', 'schmidtnielsen1984'))` for comprehensive reviews) and many of these variables are also associated with $B_i$ `r myCite(c('mcnab2002book', 'konarzewski2013jcompphysb', 'white2013jcompphysb'))`.  
  
In contrast to studies that make use of intact individual organisms, colonial animals provide an opportunity for definitive tests of metabolic theories. Colony size can be manipulated experimentally, hence allowing for the potential to remove the confounding effects of body size and life-history traits (e.g. `r myCite('white2011amnat')`). Furthermore, different colonial species may grow in different dimensions, and the mass-scaling exponent $\alpha$ is explicitly predicted to change with number of body dimensions `r myCite(c('nakaya2005procb', 'white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`. For example, the fractal geometry model `r myCite(c('west1997science', 'west1999science'))` predicts that $\alpha = n/(n + 1)$ for a $n$-dimensional organism, hence a value of $\alpha$ = 0.75 is predicted for three-dimensional animals while a value of $\alpha$ = 0.67 is predicted for two-dimensional animals (but see `r myCite(c('enquist2009nature', 'savage2008ploscompbiol', 'banavar2010pnas', 'kolokotrones2010nature', 'price2007pnas', 'koontz2009amjbot'))`). On the other hand, DEB predicts that metabolic scaling in colonial organisms are dependent upon growth rate (which is in turn influenced by temperature) and the relative contributions of growing and non-growing zooids to whole-colony metabolism.  
  
In the present study we experimentally manipulate size in different colonial marine organisms from two phyla (Bryozoa [Ectoprocta] and Porifera) in order to test whether the mass scaling and temperature dependence of metabolic rates interact `r myCite(c('white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`. In doing so, we explicitly test if these interactions are general or species specific.  
  
**Material and Methods**  
  
*1. Animal collections*  
To collect our study organisms, roughened acetate sheets secured to the underside of 6 mm thick PVC sheets suspended from floating pontoons at a depth of 1 m were deployed at Manly Boat Harbour, Queensland, Australia (27˚27' S, 153˚11' E) and checked regularly to remove fouling organisms other than our species of interest: *Bugula neritina* and *B. stolonifera* (arborescent bryozoan), *Hippopodina* sp. (encrusting bryozoan), and an unidentified species of sponge belonging to the Microcionidae family `r myCite('hart2009ecology')` (Table 1). After 6 weeks in the field, sheets bearing colonies were returned to the University of Queensland where they were maintained in aerated seawater for up to 48 h prior to measurements. For encrusting colonies, sections of acetate bearing whole colonies were then cut from the sheets and fragmented (see `r myCite('white2011amnat')` for details and tests of potential experimental artefacts). Arborescent colonies were cut directly from the acetate sheets and fragmented.  
  
*2. Respiration measurements*  
Individual metabolic rates (**provide units**, *n* = `r nrow(metRates)`), $B_i$, were measured as rate of oxygen consumption, $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ of colony fragments was measured at 10 or 25 ˚C using a 144-channel PreSens Sensor Dish Reader (SDR, AS-1 Scientific, Wellington, New Zealand) according to standard techniques `r myCite(c('koster2008meps', 'lighton2008book', 'white2011amnat'))`. $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ was measured by placing the colony or fragment in a glass vial containing 0.2$\mu$m filtered sea water and a non-consumptive $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ sensor spot and calculated from the rate of change of $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ saturation ($m_a$, % h^‑1^) as:  
  
$$\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2} = ‑1 \left(\frac{m_a – m_b}{100}\right) V~{\beta}_{\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}}$$, (1)  
  
where $m_b$ is the rate of change of $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ saturation for blank vials containing no bryozoans (% h^-1^), ${\beta}_{\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}}$ is the oxygen capacitance of air-saturated sea water at 10 ˚C (6.26 ml l^-1^) or 24 ˚C (4.615 ml l^-1^) [**double-check these numbers. Shouldn't the second be 25 ˚C?**] `r myCite('cameron1986book')` and $V$ is water volume (chambers were 0.005 l in volume and water volume was calculated by subtracting the volume of acetate and animals). At least four blank vials were recorded simultaneously with each 24-well plate to account for microbial oxygen consumption and sensor spots were calibrated with air-saturated seawater (100 % A.S.) and water containing 2% sodium sulfite (0% A.S.). Following measurement of $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$, colonies or fragments were blotted dry and weighed to 0.1 mg (Sartorius A 200 S, Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany). All measurements of $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ were made in one of four dark constant temperature cabinets, with temperatures within a run randomised among cabinets.  
  
*3. Statistical analyses*  
To test for the interacting effects of body mass and temperature on metabolic rate across species, we fitted a three-way interaction linear model using log-transformed data  
  
$$\textrm{ln}B_i \sim \textrm{ln}M_i * Temperature * Species$$, (2)  
  
where mass (mg), $\textrm{ln}M_i$, is a continuous variable, while temperature (two levels: 10 ˚C and 25 ˚C) and species (four levels corresponding to the four species) are categorical variables. With this model, we allow each species to have a different mass-scaling slope that may change with temperature (4 $\times$ 2 = 8 parameters); it also accounts for species- and temperature-specific deviations on the metabolic normalisation (i.e. statistical model intercept; 4 $\times$ 2 = 8 parameters). We also included experimental conveniences (plate reader, $\Delta P_r$, and date, $\Delta D$) as random effects on the metabolic normalisation to help control for natural experimental variability (3 additional hyper parameters corresponding to the standard deviation of $\Delta P_r$, $\Delta D$ and random-effects residual).  
  
We then performed a model selection by comparing the statistical model in equation 2 with a simpler two-way interaction model of similar structure,  
  
$$\textrm{ln}B_i \sim \textrm{ln}M_i * Temperature + Species$$. (3)  
  
In this model, different from the model in equation 2, the mass scaling slope is no longer allowed to vary across different species, but is still allowed to vary between different temperatures (1 $\times$ 2 = 2 parameters). The metabolic normalisation, however, is still allowed to vary across species (4 $\times$ 1 = 4 parameters) and between temperatures (1 additional parameters), and random effects were maintained (i.e. 3 hyper parameters). Equation 3 represents a statistical model nested in the model represented by equation 2, and therefore their performance can be directly assessed `r myCite('zuur2009book')`. Such comparison allowed us to formally test our main hypothesis of significant mass-temperature interactions across different species.  
  
Both models were fitted in a Bayesian framework by calling *JAGS* version 3.4.0 from the R package *R2jags* version 0.05-03 `r myCite('r2jags')` in order to derive posterior distributions and associated 95% credible intervals (CIs) for the fitted parameters. Random effects were assumed to be normally distributed, with means of 0. Fitted parameters were assigned priors that were vague (i.e. locally uniform over the region supported by the likelihood) `r myCite('kruschke2014book')`. The posterior distributions of model parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by constructing three chains of 500,000 steps each. Chains were thinned using a 250-step interval, so a total of 6,000 steps were retained to estimate posterior distributions (i.e. 3 $\times$ 500,000/250 = 6,000). Models were compared adopting Deviance information criterion (DIC), which are commonly used in Bayesian model selection and are analogously similar to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), as this method also penalises for additional model parameters `r myCite('hooten2015ecology')`. We adopted a conservative approach, and models were considered significantly different only if DIC units differed by > 10 units `r myCite('spiegelhalter2002jrss')`. All data and code necessary to reproduce this paper, its analyses, tables and figures can be obtained on GitHub https://github.com/dbarneche/MTRBrEs.  
  
**Results**  
  
Our model selection approach indicated that the three-way interaction model (equation 2) performed significantly better than the two-way interaction model (equation 3) ($\Delta$d.f. = `r deltaDF`; $\Delta$DIC = `r rounded(deltaDIC)`), thus implying that different species present different interactions between mass-scaling and temperature dependence. Particularly, the best model yields no interaction between mass scaling and temperature dependence for *Bugula stolonifera* and the Microcionidae sponge (large overlap between 95% credible  intervals). On the other hand, *Bugula neritina* and *Hippopodina* sp. present opposing interactions (Figure 1). For example, parameter estimates indicate that the difference in metabolic rates between 25 ˚C and 10 ˚C for *Hippopodina* sp. decreases `r rounded(tempDeltas[1,'tempDelta'])`-fold moving from `r round(exp(2))` to `r round(exp(5))` mg. On the other hand, rates increase `r rounded(1/tempDeltas[3,'tempDelta'])`-fold along the same body-mass gradient for *Bugula neritina*.  
  
**Compare model estimates with WBE and DEB predictions?**
  
**Discussion**  
  
The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory predicts individual metabolism on the basis of energy allocation to assimilation, maintenance, growth, and maturation `r myCite('kooijman2009book')`. On the basis of this, DEB theory predicts a complex three-way interaction between growth form, temperature, and size `r myCite(c('white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`. Thus, DEB not only predicts variation in the scaling exponent of metabolic rate, it does so in a quantitative way. In support of this prediction of DEB, we show that the effect of temperature on the scaling of metabolic rate in colonial organisms depends on the growth form of the colony. The scaling exponent of metabolic rate is temperature-dependent for encrusting colonies (Figure 2A), where the mass of growing units is proportional to colony $M_i^{\sim 0.5}$, but not for arborescent colonies, where the total mass of the growing units is proportional to colony $M_i^{\sim 1}$ (Figure 2B). Such patterns cannot be predicted by models in which the scaling exponent of metabolic rate is assumed to be invariant.  
  
We found that both $\alpha$ and $B_o$ covary with each other and with temperature in encrusting species -- this covariance has also been noted across other species and has some interesting implications for life-history theory. $B_o$ represents the mass-independent metabolic rate of an organism of unit mass, and $\alpha$ represents the power function by which metabolism increases with mass. At higher temperatures, $B_o$ increases and $\alpha$ decreases -- in other words, the metabolic costs of existing, regardless of size, increase with temperature and the metabolic efficiency benefits of increased size increase with temperature. Thus, all else being equal, increases in temperature increase the metabolic benefits of attaining a larger size while decreases in temperature reduce mass-independent metabolic costs as well as reduce the metabolic benefits of attaining a larger size. We would therefore predict that species living at higher temperatures should allocate more resources to attaining larger sizes (as opposed to reproduction etc) while species living at lower temperatures will be under less pressure to allocate resources to size. Of course, there are many extrinsic factors that will affect selection on body size (e.g. predation, competition, etc) and a sizable theory discusses this issue but there are few formal considerations of the implications of temperature of $\alpha$ for life-history theory. Nevertheless, such differentials in the costs and benefits of attaining large size may help to explain the slow pace of life in species living in cold temperatures.  
  
**A little example to consider.**  
  
- Hot temperature, a = 0.6, B = 0.4. Cold temperature, a = 0.4, B = 0.6.  
- Energetic savings of being 2 units of size versus 10 units in size  
- Metabolic cost of being alive  for  2 unit size critter at high temperature is 0.79 or ~40% of total mass  
- Metabolic cost of being alive for 2 unit size critter at low temperature is 0.60 or ~30% of total mass  
- Metabolic cost of being alive for 10 unit size critter at high temperature is 1.5 or ~15% of total mass  
- Metabolic cost of being alive for 10 unit size critter at low temperature is 1.59 or ~16% of total mass  
- So 5 fold increase in size gets you a 2.667 increase in efficiency at high temperatures but same increase in size at low temperature gets you only a 1.85 increase in efficiency. That's a pretty big deal and we should say something about it!  
- Another example, at high temperatures, 10 colonies of 100 units in size will have a cumulative metabolism of 37 while 100 colonies of 10 units in size will have a cumulative metabolism of 150. (same overall mass). At low temperatures with same colony sizes and numbers, they are  63 and 159.  The ratio goes from 4.05 to 2.52. Massive change in metabolism if fragmentation occurs at high temperature, less change if fragmentation occurs at low temperatures.  
  
New paras:  
- Many organisms exhibit multiple growth forms (encrusting and arborescent); disadvantage of arborescent is that there is no increase in efficiency with size.  
- Lack of evidence for WBE. Mass-scaling exponent not universal across the species analysed, and clear interactions with temperature.  
- Winners and losers across latitudinal gradients, and under increased temperatures. Arborsecents are predicted to be less common in warm waters,  
- Pocilliporids fast growing arborescent coral; massive corals are slow growing and something… This provides a mechanistic explanation for why arborescent corals grow fast, but attain smaller sizes than massive corals.
