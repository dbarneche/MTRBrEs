**Summary**  

1. Organismal metabolic rate often scales allometrically with body mass, both inter and intra-specifically. Metabolic rates are also known to increase with temperature, but most theoretical tests of mass scaling and temperature dependence have treated both phenomena independently.  
2. In the present study, we use a manipulative approach to test for an association between metabolic mass scaling and temperature dependence in four species belonging to two phyla of colonial marine invertebrates.  
3. We show that mass-scaling exponents and temperature dependencies interact in different ways for different species. In so doing, we discuss the potentials of our results to multi-level scaling theory, showing that some species might be winners while others might be losers under different temperature scenarios.  
4. These findings highlight the need for new metabolic theory that formally incorporate interactions between mass-scaling and temperature dependence in ectothermic organisms, in order to better explain documented variation in the mass-scaling exponent of metabolic rate, and lead to novel and testable predictions for associations between individual metabolism and community structure.

**Introduction**  
  
Metabolic theories have been lauded as having the potential to unite hierarchical levels of biological organisation, from individuals to ecosystems `r myCite(c('nisbet2000janimecol', 'brown2004', 'vandermeer2006tree'))`. Although definitive tests of their underlying assumptions remain rare `r myCite(c('kearney2012amnat', 'newberry2015ploscomputbiol'))`, myriad studies examined their predictions with regards to the relationship between individual level metabolic rates, $B_i$, and individual body mass, $M_i$ `r myCite(c('kleiber1932', 'kleiber1961', 'peters1983', 'schmidtnielsen1984', 'glazier2005biolrev', 'delong2010', 'glazier2010biolrev'))`. The relationship between $B_i$ and $M_i$ is typically described by a power function of the form $B_i = B_oM_i^{\alpha}$, where $B_o$ is a normalisation constant independent of mass and $\alpha$ is a dimensionless scaling exponent. For most animals, individual metabolic rate scales sub-linearly with body mass, with $\alpha$ estimates falling between 0.5 and 1, and averaging around 0.75 `r myCite(c('kleiber1961', 'savage2004', 'glazier2005biolrev', 'delong2010'))`. Metabolic rates are also influenced by temperature. Two prevalent competing metabolic theories, the fractal geometry model `r myCite(c('west1997science', 'west1999science'))`, and  the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory for metabolic organisation `r myCite('kooijman2009book')`, provide opposing views on the role of temperature on metabolic rates and the relationship between the mass scaling of metabolic rates and temperature: the former assumes that temperature affects the metabolic normalisation only `r myCite('gillooly2001')`, i.e. mass-scaling and temperature dependence are independent; contrarily, the latter predicts changing relationships between mass scaling and temperature dependence through the effects of temperature on assimilation, maintenance, growth, and maturation `r myCite('kooijman2009book')`.  
  
Empirical studies of the intra-specific association between $B_i$ and $M_i$ have revealed that the value of $\alpha$ is associated with many biotic and abiotic variables, including pH `r myCite('vaca2010biollett')`, temperature `r myCite('killen2010ele')`, predation `r myCite('glazier2011ecolmongr')`, inbreeding `r myCite('ketola2012jlinsoc')`, and a range of others (for reviews see `r myCite(c('glazier2005biolrev', 'white2013jcompphysb'))`). Similarly, inter-specific studies have shown that the value of $\alpha$ varies among taxa and/or locations (e.g. `r myCite(c('lovegrove2000amnat', 'white2012procb', 'barneche2014ele'))`), with metabolic level (e.g. `r myCite('glazier2010biolrev')`), and sometimes with body mass (e.g. `r myCite(c('white2009evolution', 'kolokotrones2010nature'))`). While these intra- and inter-specific studies demonstrate clearly that the value of $\alpha$ is not fixed, they each share a common limitation: each study tests for an association between $\alpha$ and a biotic or abiotic variable, using a value of $\alpha$ that is estimated from the association between $B_i$ and $M_i$ for individuals or species of different size. Such correlative studies cannot address the causal association between $B_i$ and $M_i$, because $M_i$ is correlated with a range of other environmental, physiological, and life history variables (see e.g. `r myCite(c('peters1983', 'calder1984book', 'schmidtnielsen1984'))` for comprehensive reviews) and many of these variables are also associated with $B_i$ `r myCite(c('mcnab2002book', 'konarzewski2013jcompphysb', 'white2013jcompphysb'))`.  
  
In contrast to studies that make use of intact individual organisms, colonial animals provide an opportunity for definitive tests of metabolic theories. Colony size can be manipulated experimentally, hence allowing for the potential to remove the confounding effects of body size and life-history traits (e.g. `r myCite('white2011amnat')`). Furthermore, different colonial species may grow in different dimensions, and the mass-scaling exponent $\alpha$ is explicitly predicted to change with number of body dimensions `r myCite(c('nakaya2005procb', 'white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`. For example, the fractal geometry model `r myCite(c('west1997science', 'west1999science'))` predicts that $\alpha = n/(n + 1)$ for a $n$-dimensional organism, hence a value of $\alpha$ = 0.75 is predicted for three-dimensional animals while a value of $\alpha$ = 0.67 is predicted for two-dimensional animals (but see `r myCite(c('enquist2009nature', 'savage2008ploscompbiol', 'banavar2010pnas', 'kolokotrones2010nature', 'price2007pnas', 'koontz2009amjbot'))`). On the other hand, DEB predicts that metabolic scaling in colonial organisms are dependent upon growth rate (which is in turn influenced by temperature) and the relative contributions of growing and non-growing zooids to whole-colony metabolism.  
  
In the present study we experimentally manipulate size in different colonial marine organisms from two phyla (Bryozoa [Ectoprocta] and Porifera) in order to test whether the mass scaling and temperature dependence of metabolic rates interact `r myCite(c('white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`. In doing so, we explicitly test if these interactions are general or species specific.  
  
**Material and Methods**  
  
*1. Animal collections*  
To collect our study organisms, roughened acetate sheets secured to the underside of 6 mm thick PVC sheets suspended from floating pontoons at a depth of 1 m were deployed at Manly Boat Harbour, Queensland, Australia (27˚27' S, 153˚11' E) and checked regularly to remove fouling organisms other than our species of interest: *Bugula neritina* and *B. stolonifera* (arborescent bryozoan), *Hippopodina* sp. (encrusting bryozoan), and an unidentified species of sponge belonging to the Microcionidae family `r myCite('hart2009ecology')` (Table 1). After 6 weeks in the field, sheets bearing colonies were returned to the University of Queensland where they were maintained in aerated seawater for up to 48 h prior to measurements. For encrusting colonies, sections of acetate bearing whole colonies were then cut from the sheets and fragmented (see `r myCite('white2011amnat')` for details and tests of potential experimental artefacts). Arborescent colonies were cut directly from the acetate sheets and fragmented.  
  
*2. Respiration measurements*  
Individual metabolic rates (**provide units**, *n* = `r nrow(metRates)`), $B_i$, were measured as rate of oxygen consumption, $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ of colony fragments was measured at 10 or 25 ˚C using a 144-channel PreSens Sensor Dish Reader (SDR, AS-1 Scientific, Wellington, New Zealand) according to standard techniques `r myCite(c('koster2008meps', 'lighton2008book', 'white2011amnat'))`. $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ was measured by placing the colony or fragment in a glass vial containing 0.2$\mu$m filtered sea water and a non-consumptive $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ sensor spot and calculated from the rate of change of $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ saturation ($m_a$, % h^‑1^) as:  
  
$$\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2} = ‑1 \left(\frac{m_a – m_b}{100}\right) V~{\beta}_{\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}}$$, (1)  
  
where $m_b$ is the rate of change of $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ saturation for blank vials containing no bryozoans (% h^-1^), ${\beta}_{\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}}$ is the oxygen capacitance of air-saturated sea water at 10 ˚C (6.26 ml l^-1^) or 24 ˚C (4.615 ml l^-1^) [**double-check these numbers. Shouldn't the second be 25 ˚C?**] `r myCite('cameron1986book')` and $V$ is water volume (chambers were 0.005 l in volume and water volume was calculated by subtracting the volume of acetate and animals). At least four blank vials were recorded simultaneously with each 24-well plate to account for microbial oxygen consumption and sensor spots were calibrated with air-saturated seawater (100 % A.S.) and water containing 2% sodium sulfite (0% A.S.). Following measurement of $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$, colonies or fragments were blotted dry and weighed to 0.1 mg (Sartorius A 200 S, Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany). All measurements of $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ were made in one of four dark constant temperature cabinets, with temperatures within a run randomised among cabinets.  
  
*3. Statistical analyses*  
**Things to possibly improve -- since we use a Bayesian approach, why let parameters be estimated from data (i.e. vague priors)? Why not adopt strong priors? Maybe letting it estimate is better to check whether parameters follow one or another theory?**  
**Things to possibly improve -- Include more models for model selection? E.g. two-way models with species*temp interaction or species*mass? lme4 already indicates that they are not better, I'm pretty sure the Bayesian DIC will follow results along the same lines. We'd be covering our bases better beforehand before a reviewer asks for this**  
  
To test for the interacting effects of body mass and temperature on metabolic rate across species, we fitted a three-way interaction linear model using log-transformed data  
  
$$\textrm{ln}B_i \sim \textrm{ln}M_i * Temperature * Species$$, (2)  
  
where mass (mg), $\textrm{ln}M_i$, is a continuous variable, while temperature (two levels: 10 ˚C and 25 ˚C) and species (four levels corresponding to the four species) are categorical variables. With this model, we allow each species to have a different mass-scaling slope that may change with temperature (4 $\times$ 2 = 8 parameters); it also accounts for species- and temperature-specific deviations on the metabolic normalisation (i.e. statistical model intercept; 4 $\times$ 2 = 8 parameters). We also included experimental conveniences (plate reader, $\Delta P_r$, and date, $\Delta D$) as random effects on the metabolic normalisation to help control for natural experimental variability (3 additional hyper parameters corresponding to the standard deviation of $\Delta P_r$, $\Delta D$ and random-effects residual).  
  
We then performed a model selection by comparing the statistical model in equation 2 with a simpler two-way interaction model of similar structure,  
  
$$\textrm{ln}B_i \sim \textrm{ln}M_i * Temperature + Species$$. (3)  
  
In this model, different from the model in equation 2, the mass scaling slope is no longer allowed to vary across different species, but is still allowed to vary between different temperatures (1 $\times$ 2 = 2 parameters). The metabolic normalisation, however, is still allowed to vary across species (4 $\times$ 1 = 4 parameters) and between temperatures (1 additional parameter), and random effects were maintained (i.e. 3 hyper parameters). Equation 3 represents a statistical model nested in the model represented by equation 2, and therefore their performance can be directly assessed `r myCite('zuur2009book')`. Such comparison allowed us to formally test our main hypothesis of significant mass-temperature interactions across different species.  
  
Both models were fitted in a Bayesian framework by calling *JAGS* version 3.4.0 from the R package *R2jags* version 0.05-03 `r myCite('r2jags')` in order to derive posterior distributions and associated 95% credible intervals (CIs) for the fitted parameters. Random effects were assumed to be normally distributed, with means of 0. Fitted parameters were assigned priors that were vague (i.e. locally uniform over the region supported by the likelihood) `r myCite('kruschke2014book')`. The posterior distributions of model parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by constructing three chains of 500,000 steps each. Chains were thinned using a 250-step interval, so a total of 6,000 steps were retained to estimate posterior distributions (i.e. 3 $\times$ 500,000/250 = 6,000). Models were compared adopting Deviance information criterion (DIC), which are commonly used in Bayesian model selection and are analogously similar to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), as this method also penalises for additional model parameters `r myCite('hooten2015ecology')`. We adopted a conservative approach, and models were considered significantly different only if DIC units differed by > 10 units `r myCite('spiegelhalter2002jrss')`.

**Results**  
  
Our model selection approach indicated that the three-way interaction model (equation 2) performed significantly better than the two-way interaction model (equation 3) ($\Delta$d.f. = `r deltaDF`; $\Delta$DIC = `r rounded(deltaDIC)`), thus implying that different species present different interactions between mass-scaling and temperature dependence. Particularly, the best model yields no interaction between mass scaling and temperature dependence for *Bugula stolonifera* and the Microcionidae sponge (large overlap between 95% credible intervals for the mass-scaling slopes, $\alpha$) (Figure 1). Still, while the mass-scaling slopes are statistically the same between temperatures for these species, there is evidence for higher metabolic normalisations (i.e. intercepts), $B_o$, at higher temperatures (though not statistically significant for Microcionidae). For example, metabolic rates increase `r rounded(exp(averageEstimates$lnB25[averageEstimates$species == 'Stolonifera'])/exp(averageEstimates$lnB10[averageEstimates$species == 'Stolonifera']))`-fold between 10 ˚C and 25 ˚C for *B. stolonifera*, yielding a $Q_{10}$ of `r rounded(q10andErs$q10[q10andErs$species == 'Stolonifera'])`. It is worth noting that this $Q_{10}$ value is equivalent to an activation energy of `r rounded(q10andErs$er[q10andErs$species == 'Stolonifera'], 2)` eV (i.e. $E_r = \frac{k \times 283.15 \times 298.15 \times 1.5 \times \textrm{ln}Q_{10}}{(298.15 - 283.15)}$, where $E_r$ is an activation energy and $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, 8.62 $\times$ 10^-5^ eV K^-1^), which is consistent with the average 06 -- 0.7 eV reported in the Metabolic Theory of Ecology literature `r myCite('yvondurocher2012a')`. Different from the above species, the best model indicates that *Bugula neritina* and *Hippopodina* sp. present opposing interactions between mass-scaling and temperature dependence (Figure 1). For example, average posterior parameter estimates indicate that the difference in metabolic rates between 25 ˚C and 10 ˚C for *Hippopodina* sp. decreases, on average, `r rounded(tempDeltas[1,'tempDelta'])`-fold moving from `r round(exp(2))` to `r round(exp(5))` mg. For *Bugula neritina*, however, rates increase `r rounded(1/tempDeltas[3,'tempDelta'])`-fold along the same body-mass gradient.  

Posterior distributions for mass-scaling exponents show varied consistency with predictions from the two metabolic theories. For example, *Hippopodina* sp. shows exponents that encompass both 0.67 (**DEB prediction??**; Fractal geometry model prediction for 2-D organisms; `r myCite('koontz2009amjbot')`) and 0.75 (Fractal geometry model prediction for 3-D organisms `r myCite(c('west1997science', 'west1999science'))`) at 10 ˚C (95% CI: `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Bryo', 's10_2.5'], 2)` -- `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Bryo', 's10_97.5'], 2)`), but that are significantly shallower than 0.75 at 25 ˚C (95% CI: `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Bryo', 's25_2.5'], 2)` -- `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Bryo', 's25_97.5'], 2)`). On the other hand, *Bugula neritina* presents scaling exponents that overlap both 0.67 and 0.75 at 25 ˚C (95% CI: `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Bugula', 's25_2.5'], 2)` -- `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Bugula', 's25_97.5'], 2)`), but are significantly shallower than these values at 10 ˚C (95% CI: `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Bugula', 's10_2.5'], 2)` -- `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Bugula', 's10_97.5'], 2)`). Microcionidae presents exponents that only overlap 0.67 at 10 ˚C, but not at 25 ˚C (95% CI at 10 ˚C: `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Sponge', 's10_2.5'], 2)` -- `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Sponge', 's10_97.5'], 2)`; 95% CI at 25 ˚C: `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Sponge', 's25_2.5'], 2)` -- `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Sponge', 's25_97.5'], 2)`). Finally, *Bugula stolonifera* presents values that overlap both 0.67 and 0.75 at both temperatures (95% CI at 10 ˚C: `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Stolonifera', 's10_2.5'], 2)` -- `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Stolonifera', 's10_97.5'], 2)`; 95% CI at 25 ˚C: `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Stolonifera', 's25_2.5'], 2)` -- `r rounded(ci95Estimates[ci95Estimates$species == 'Stolonifera', 's25_97.5'], 2)`).  
  
**Discussion**  
  
Here, we show experimentally that the mass-scaling of metabolic rates changes between two extreme temperatures, and in different ways across different species of marine invertebrates. We build on recent empirical evidence documenting similar changes (e.g. `r myCite('killen2010ele')`), yielding further support to the need for new metabolic theories (or reformulation of current ones) that formally incorporate interactive effects between mass scaling and temperature dependence of biological rates. *Currently, the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory predicts individual metabolism on the basis of energy allocation to assimilation, maintenance, growth, and maturation `r myCite('kooijman2009book')`, yielding a complex three-way interaction between growth form, temperature, and size `r myCite(c('white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`.* **If we want to keep this comment on DEB, we will have to formally present how and what predictions DEB makes for changes in mass-scaling between different temperatures**. Our results, however, do not indicate consistent mass-temperature interactions across growth forms. Possibly, another important axis involved, which has not been considered here, is the acclimation capacity of species upon acute temperature changes (e.g. `r myCite('rezende2014functecol')`). Our findings are constrained to acute-related changes, and therefore do not consider temporal acclimation or even adaptation to changes in environmental temperature.  
  
The fact that $B_o$ and $\alpha$ covary in different ways depending on species and temperature (Figure 1) suggests that the metabolic costs of maintenance will vary for different species at different environmental temperatures. For example, *Bugula neritina* presented a shallower mass-scaling exponent at colder temperatures, possibly indicating that large cold-environment individuals are more efficient in spending energy than counterparts in warm environments. Thus, for this species, all else being equal, increases in temperature decrease the metabolic benefits of attaining a larger size while decreases in temperature reduce the metabolic normalisation. On the other hand, our results indicate that *Hippopodina* sp. presents a reduction in metabolic benefits of attaining a larger size at colder temperatures. Thus, for this encrusting species, one could predict that individuals living at higher temperatures should allocate more resources to attaining larger sizes (as opposed to reproduction, for instance) while individuals living at lower temperatures will be under less pressure to allocate resources to size. Importantly, though, we note that there are many extrinsic factors that may affect abundance and selection on body size (e.g. predation, competition, etc; `r myCite('barneche2016procb')`). Yet, such differentials in the costs and benefits of attaining large size may help explain why some species living in cold temperatures present a slower pace of life (e.g. `r myCite('rosa2010jmba')`). Moreover, they may represent necessary improvements on current attempts to scale up energy from individuals to higher levels of organisation (e.g. `r myCite(c('allen2005','yvondurocher2012b','barneche2014ele','barneche2016procb'))`).  
  
Importantly, some of our results are also consistent with existing theoretical predictions. 
- Temperature dependence and mass-scaling of *B. stolonifera* consistent with MTE. Why this species only?
