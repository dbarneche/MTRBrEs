**Abstract**  

Organismal metabolic rate often scales allometrically with body mass.  This pattern is observed in both interspecific and ontogenetic (intraspecific) studies, but the causal basis of variation in the allometric scaling of metabolism remains unresolved.  In the present study, we use a manipulative approach to test for an association between ontogenetic metabolic scaling and the rate and form of growth in three phyla of colonial marine organisms. Based on a Dynamic Energy Budget model that predicts the scaling of metabolic rate on the basis of energy allocation to assimilation, maintenance, growth, and maturation, we hypothesise that the scaling exponent of metabolic rate for colonial organisms should be dependent on growth rate for two-dimensional (encrusting) colonies, but not for three-dimensional (arborescent) colonies.  In support of this hypothesis, we found that the scaling exponent of metabolic rate decreased with increasing growth rate for encrusting colonies, but not for arborescent ones. These findings highlight the importance of growth for metabolic scaling during ontogeny, suggest that differences in patterns of growth might explain at least some of the documented variation in the scaling exponent of metabolic rate, and lead to novel and testable predictions for associations between individual metabolism and community structure.  
  
**Introduction**  

Metabolic theory has been lauded as having the potential to unite hierarchical levels of biological organisation `r myCite(c('nisbet2000janimecol', 'brown2004', 'vandermeer2006tree'))`, but definitive tests of the mechanistic theories proposed to underlie the putative link between individual metabolic rate ($B_i$) and ecological patterns remain rare `r myCite('kearney2012amnat')`. Examination of the relationship between $B_i$ and individual body mass, $M_i$, provides an opportunity to test the mechanistic basis of metabolic theory, but manipulative experiments that examine this relationship are also rare `r myCite(c('kearney2012amnat', 'glazier2005biolrev', 'white2013jcompphysb'))`. The relationship between $B_i$ and $M_i$ is typically described by a power function of the form $B_i = B_oM_i^{\alpha}. For most animals, the value of $\alpha$ lies between 0.5 and 1, indicating that individual metabolic rate scales sub-linearly with body mass `r myCite(c('schmidtnielsen1984', 'savage2004', 'glazier2005biolrev'))`. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the intra-specific association between $B_i$ and $M_i$ have revealed that the value of $\alpha$ is associated with many biotic and abiotic variables, including pH `r myCite('vaca2010biollett')`, temperature `r myCite('killen2010ele')`, predation `r myCite('glazier2011ecolmongr')`, inbreeding `r myCite('ketola2012jlinsoc')`, and a range of others (for reviews see `r myCite(c('glazier2005biolrev', 'white2013jcompphysb'))`). Similarly, inter-specific studies have shown that the value of $\alpha$ varies spatially and among taxa (e.g. `r myCite(c('lovegrove2000amnat', 'white2012procb'))`), with metabolic level (e.g. `r myCite('glazier2010biolrev')`), and sometimes with body mass (e.g. `r myCite(c('white2009evolution', 'kolokotrones2010nature'))`). While these intra- and inter-specific studies demonstrate clearly that the value of $\alpha$ is not fixed, they each share a common limitation: each study tests for an association between $\alpha$ and a biotic or abiotic variable, using a value of $\alpha$ that is estimated from the association between $B_i$ and $M_i$ for individuals or species of different size. Such correlative studies cannot address the causal association between $B_i$ and $M_i$, because $M_i$ is correlated with a range of other environmental, physiological, and life history variables (see e.g. `r myCite(c('peters1983', 'calder1984book', 'schmidtnielsen1984'))` for comprehensive reviews) and many of these variables are also associated with $B_i$ `r myCite(c('mcnab2002book', 'konarzewski2013jcompphysb', 'white2013jcompphysb'))`.  
  
In contrast to studies of intact individual organisms, colonial animals provide an opportunity for definitive tests of metabolic theory because colony size can be manipulated experimentally and several metabolic theories predict $\alpha$ explicitly for these animals `r myCite(c('nakaya2005procb', 'white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`. The fractal geometry model of West *et al.* `r myCite(c('west1997science', 'west1999science'))`, for example, predicts $\alpha$ on the basis of the transport of essential materials through space-filling outward-directed fractal distribution networks. For an $n$-dimensional organism, this model predicts that $\alpha$ should be equal to $n/(n ‑ 1)$, so a value of $\alpha$ = 0.75 is predicted for three-dimensional animals, and a value of $\alpha$ = 0.67 is predicted for two-dimensional ones `r myCite(c('west1997science', 'west1999science'))` see also `r myCite('koontz2009amjbot')`. However, subsequent work has demonstrated that these canonical predictions of the fractal model are dependent on a range of assumptions `r myCite(c('enquist2009nature', 'savage2008ploscompbiol', 'banavar2010pnas', 'kolokotrones2010nature'))`, and modifications of these can yield exponents that vary between 0.5–-1.0 (e.g. `r myCite('price2007pnas')`). For example, the predicted scaling exponent for a two-dimensional organism with a plane-filling network and area-increasing branching is 0.86 `r myCite('price2007pnas')`. Thus, the fractal model predicts an exponent of either 0.67 `r myCite(c('west1997science', 'west1999science'))` or 0.86 `r myCite('price2007pnas')` for two-dimensional animals, depending on the assumptions used. However, the fractal geometry model makes no predictions about the additional effects of biotic and abiotic variables on the value of $\alpha$, unless these variables have effects on the geometry of the distribution network.  
  
The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory for metabolic organisation predicts patterns of growth and metabolic scaling on the basis of as generalised surface area (source) and volume (sink) relationships, and predicts the values of both $B_o$ and $\alpha$ during ontogeny on the basis of size-dependent variation in energy allocation to assimilation, maintenance, growth, and maturation `r myCite('kooijman2009book')`. Biotic and abiotic variables can therefore influence the predicted values of $\alpha$ through their effects on these processes. In the case of colonial organisms, DEB theory predicts that biotic and abiotic variables that influence growth rate will have different effects on $\alpha$ for two-dimensional encrusting and three-dimensional arborescent (tree-like) colonies, because patterns of growth differ among these forms. For encrusting colonies, the proportion of growing zooids varies as a function of colony circumference, and therefore scales as $M_i^{\sim 0.5}$. In contrast, the number of growing zooids for arborescent colonies scales as $M_i^{\sim 1}$, because a bifurcating tree with $n$ tips has $n-1$ nodes and a mass proportional to $2n-1$ (Figure 1). Given that the DEB predictions for metabolic scaling in colonial organisms depend upon growth rate and the relative contributions of growing and non-growing zooids to whole-colony metabolism, the utility of the DEB model in predicting variation in $\alpha$ can be tested in two ways. Firstly, because the relative contribution of growing and non-growing zooids to whole-colony metabolism varies with growth rate, which is influenced by temperature, a negative relationship between temperature and $\alpha$ is predicted for two-dimensional encrusting colonies `r myCite(c('white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`. Since the normalization of the scaling relationship, $B_o$, will increase with temperature due to the thermodynamic effects of temperature on metabolic rate, this prediction will manifest as a negative association between $\alpha$ and $B_o$. Second, the influence of temperature on the scaling exponent of metabolic rate is predicted to differ among growth forms. This prediction arises because the number of growing tips of an arborescent colony scales as $M_i^{\sim 1}$ (Figure 1), so only the elevation of the relationship between whole-colony metabolic rate and colony mass is predicted to be influenced temperature and no association between between $\alpha$ and $B_o$ is predicted.  
  
In the present study we experimentally test these two explicit predictions of the DEB model for metabolic scaling in colonial organisms by examining the effects of colony form (encrusting or arborescent) and temperature (as a proxy for growth rate) on the scaling of metabolic rate for colonial marine organisms from three phyla (Porifera, Bryozoa [Ectoprocta], and Chordata).  
  
**Material and Methods**  

To collect our study organisms, roughened acetate sheets secured to the underside of 6 mm thick PVC sheets suspended from floating pontoons at a depth of 1 m were deployed at Manly Boat Harbour, Queensland, Australia (27˚27' S, 153˚11' E) and checked regularly to remove fouling organisms other than our species of interest. After 6 weeks in the field, sheets bearing colonies were returned to the University of Queensland where they were maintained in aerated seawater for up to 48 h prior to measurements. For encrusting colonies, sections of acetate bearing whole colonies were then cut from the sheets and fragmented (see `r myCite('white2011amnat')` for details and tests of potential experimental artefacts). Arborescent colonies were cut directly from the acetate sheets and fragmented.  
  
The rate of oxygen consumption, $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ of colony fragments was measured at 10 or 25 ˚C using a 144-channel PreSens Sensor Dish Reader (SDR, AS-1 Scientific, Wellington, New Zealand) according to standard techniques `r myCite(c('koster2008meps', 'lighton2008book', 'white2011amnat'))`. $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ was measured by placing the colony or fragment in a glass vial containing 0.2$\mu$m filtered sea water and a non-consumptive $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ sensor spot and calculated from the rate of change of $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ saturation ($m_a$, % h^‑1^) as:  
  
$$\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2} = ‑1 \left(\frac{m_a – m_b}{100}\right) V~{\alpha}_{\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}}$$, (1)  
  
where $m_b$ is the rate of change of $\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ saturation for blank vials containing no bryozoans (% h^-1^), ${\alpha}_{\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}}$ is the oxygen capacitance of air-saturated sea water at 10 ˚C (6.26 ml l^-1^) or 24 ˚C (4.615 ml l^-1^) `r myCite('cameron1986book')` and $V$ is water volume (chambers were 0.005 l in volume and water volume was calculated by subtracting the volume of acetate and animals). At least four blank vials were recorded simultaneously with each 24-well plate to account for microbial oxygen consumption and sensor spots were calibrated with air-saturated seawater (100 % A.S.) and water containing 2% sodium sulfite (0% A.S.). Following measurement of $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$, colonies or fragments were blotted dry and weighed to 0.1 mg (Sartorius A 200 S, Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany).  All measurements of \dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2} were made in one of four dark constant temperature cabinets, with temperatures within a run randomised among cabinets.  
  
To test for the effect of growth form and temperature on the relationship between mass and metabolic rate, we used ANCOVA where mass was the continuous variable, temperature and growth form were categorical variables. When we included experimental conveniences (controlled temperature cabinet and plate(cabinet)) as random factors, these factors and their interactions with our factors of interest were not significant. As they explained little additional variance and were not of biological interest, we omitted them from the final model `r myCite('quinn2002book')`. The scaling exponent, $\alpha$, of the relationship between $\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2}$ and fragment mass, $M_i$, was then estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression of $\textrm{ln}\dot{V}\textrm{O}_\textrm{2} ~ \textrm{ln}M_i$.  
  
**Results**  
  
Three-way interaction was significant; within forms there was an interaction between temperature and logM for encrusting colonies, but not arborescent ones.  
  
**Discussion**  
  
The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory predicts individual metabolism on the basis of energy allocation to assimilation, maintenance, growth, and maturation `r myCite('kooijman2009book')`. On the basis of this, DEB theory predicts a complex three-way interaction between growth form, temperature, and size `r myCite(c('white2011amnat', 'kearney2012amnat'))`. Thus, DEB not only predicts variation in the scaling exponent of metabolic rate, it does so in a quantitative way. In support of this prediction of DEB, we show that the effect of temperature on the scaling of metabolic rate in colonial organisms depends on the growth form of the colony. The scaling exponent of metabolic rate is temperature-dependent for encrusting colonies (Figure 2A), where the mass of growing units is proportional to colony $M_i^{\sim 0.5}$, but not for arborescent colonies, where the total mass of the growing units is proportional to colony $M_i^{\sim 1}$ (Figure 2B). Such patterns cannot be predicted by models in which the scaling exponent of metabolic rate is assumed to be invariant.  
  
We found that both $\alpha$ and $B_o$ covary with each other and with temperature in encrusting species -- this covariance has also been noted across other species and has some interesting implications for life-history theory. $B_o$ represents the mass-independent metabolic rate of an organism of unit mass, and $\alpha$ represents the power function by which metabolism increases with mass. At higher temperatures, $B_o$ increases and $\alpha$ decreases -- in other words, the metabolic costs of existing, regardless of size, increase with temperature and the metabolic efficiency benefits of increased size increase with temperature. Thus, all else being equal, increases in temperature increase the metabolic benefits of attaining a larger size while decreases in temperature reduce mass-independent metabolic costs as well as reduce the metabolic benefits of attaining a larger size. We would therefore predict that species living at higher temperatures should allocate more resources to attaining larger sizes (as opposed to reproduction etc) while species living at lower temperatures will be under less pressure to allocate resources to size. Of course, there are many extrinsic factors that will affect selection on body size (e.g. predation, competition, etc) and a sizable theory discusses this issue but there are few formal considerations of the implications of temperature of $\alpha$ for life-history theory. Nevertheless, such differentials in the costs and benefits of attaining large size may help to explain the slow pace of life in species living in cold temperatures.  
  
**A little example to consider.**  
  
- Hot temperature, a = 0.6, B = 0.4. Cold temperature, a = 0.4, B = 0.6.  
- Energetic savings of being 2 units of size versus 10 units in size  
- Metabolic cost of being alive  for  2 unit size critter at high temperature is 0.79 or ~40% of total mass  
- Metabolic cost of being alive for 2 unit size critter at low temperature is 0.60 or ~30% of total mass  
- Metabolic cost of being alive for 10 unit size critter at high temperature is 1.5 or ~15% of total mass  
- Metabolic cost of being alive for 10 unit size critter at low temperature is 1.59 or ~16% of total mass  
- So 5 fold increase in size gets you a 2.667 increase in efficiency at high temperatures but same increase in size at low temperature gets you only a 1.85 increase in efficiency. That's a pretty big deal and we should say something about it!  
- Another example, at high temperatures, 10 colonies of 100 units in size will have a cumulative metabolism of 37 while 100 colonies of 10 units in size will have a cumulative metabolism of 150. (same overall mass). At low temperatures with same colony sizes and numbers, they are  63 and 159.  The ratio goes from 4.05 to 2.52. Massive change in metabolism if fragmentation occurs at high temperature, less change if fragmentation occurs at low temperatures.  
  
New paras:  
- Many organisms exhibit multiple growth forms (encrusting and arborescent); disadvantage of arborescent is that there is no increase in efficiency with size.  
- Lack of evidence for WBE. Mass-scaling exponent not universal across the species analysed, and clear interactions with temperature.  
- Winners and losers across latitudinal gradients, and under increased temperatures. Arborsecents are predicted to be less common in warm waters,  
- Pocilliporids fast growing arborescent coral; massive corals are slow growing and something… This provides a mechanistic explanation for why arborescent corals grow fast, but attain smaller sizes than massive corals.
